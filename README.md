This analysis utilizes data analytics, statistics and machine learning to identify ConocoPhillips' best-performing frac crew in the Eagle Ford shale play. From COP's completions data, 4 efficiency metrics were established to rank the frac crews in different operational aspects. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then applied on the metrics to reduce their dimensionality and create an efficiency score, which will be used to rank the service companies.

The Jupyter Notebook contains the step-by-step analysis. A summary of the results can be found in the PowerPoint slides.
